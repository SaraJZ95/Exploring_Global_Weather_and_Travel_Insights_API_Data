Part 1: WeatherPy

In this deliverable, I create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. I'll use the citipy Python library Links to an external site., the OpenWeatherMap API Links to an external site., and your problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities.
For this part, I'll use the WeatherPy.ipynb Jupyter notebook.
Psrt 2:
In this deliverable, I'll use your weather data skills to plan future vacations. Also, I'll use Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API.
The code needed to import the required libraries and load the CSV file with the weather and coordinates data for each city created in Part 1 is provided to help you get started.
For this part, I'll use the VacationPy.ipynb Jupyter notebook.

Resulted csv file and saved photos from graphs are saved in output_data folder.
